Personally I've found that DP (dynamic programming) is best
understood when reading the original mathematical treatment it was
introduced in as opposed to vague notions of "recursive
relation" and "memoization" DP is often introduced in.

As such, I've written a
[document](https://github.com/LQR471814/dynamic-programming.tex/blob/main/dynamic_programming.pdf)
(example quite shamelessly copied from some Wikipedia articles)
introducing the more "formal" foundations of DP and discusses in
more detail the problem-solving "framework" of DP.
